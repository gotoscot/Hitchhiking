# Database system project - Hitchhiking
This is a group project of the CS 411 database system course in Fall 2021 at UIUC.

## Project Description
In this project, we wish to improve users' experience for people searching a hiking trail by providing hiking buddies and suggesting near by resaurants.
We designed the relational database on MYSQL that contains the trail, user, and restaurant information tables as well as the relationships among them. The project used Django framework to connect frontend and backend and html and css for frontend display.
The final application is ran on GCP(google cloud platform):https://hitchhiking-326615.uc.r.appspot.com/
